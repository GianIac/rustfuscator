## ðŸ§  What is `rust_code_obfuscator_core`?

This crate is the **core logic** behind [Rustfuscator](https://github.com/gianiac/rustfuscator), a Rust code obfuscation tool that transforms readable Rust code into functionally equivalent but *harder-to-analyze* and *harder-to-reverse-engineer* output.

It is **not** a standalone crate â€” it powers the procedural macros and CLI-level abstractions of the [Rustfuscator project](https://github.com/gianiac/rustfuscator).
