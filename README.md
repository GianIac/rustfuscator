# rustfuscator
A lightweight Rust library for obfuscating strings and control-flow using cryptify.

The idea is to make binary analysis a little more difficult without making life too difficult for the code writer.

Features:

- Compile-time string obfuscation (obfuscate_string!)
- Control-flow obfuscation (obfuscate_flow!)
- No external tools needed â€“ just lightweight Rust macros and crates
- Built in Rust, for Rust... :)


Feel free to use it, modify it, and improve it.
